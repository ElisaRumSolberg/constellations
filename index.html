          Welcome to Star Glimpse, your gateway to the stars! Whether you're an
          astronomy enthusiast, a stargazing beginner, or simply fascinated by

      <h1>About Constellations</h1>
      <p>
        Constellations are groups of stars that form specific patterns in the
        sky and are associated with certain figures. Humanity has studied the
        night sky for thousands of years, connecting these stars to shapes and
        mythological figures. In ancient civilizations such as Mesopotamia,
        Egypt, Greece, and China, people discovered star patterns and gave them
        names. The earliest records of constellations date back to around 3000
        B.C. on Mesopotamian tablets. Greek astronomer Ptolemy, who laid the
        foundations of Western astronomy, listed 48 constellations in his work
        "Almagest" and created a systematic sky map. In addition to their
        mythological meanings, constellations played an important role in
        navigation and agriculture. Well-known constellations like Ursa Major
        (the Great Bear), Ursa Minor (the Little Bear), and Orion have served as
        guides in the night sky for travelers. Today, there are 88
        constellations officially recognized by the International Astronomical
        Union. These constellations divide the sky into specific regions, making
        astronomical observations easier.

        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>
            The appearance of constellations changes based on location and
            season. The Earth’s orbit around the Sun also changes our view of
            the night sky.

            No, while there are many stars in the sky, only some are grouped

          <p>
            Constellations are not groups of stars that formed together. Stars
            in constellations can be hundreds of light-years apart. They appear
            grouped together only from our perspective on Earth.

            Throughout history, navigators used constellations like the North
            Star in Ursa Minor to find directions. These fixed stars served as
            reliable navigation tools.

        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>
            A star’s brightness depends on its size, temperature, and distance
            from Earth. Brighter stars are often either closer to us or larger
            in size.

            Different constellations are visible at different times of the year.

            No, different cultures have their own names and stories associated

            While constellations can be seen with the naked eye, using
            binoculars or a telescope can enhance visibility and reveal more
            details.

            No, constellations and planets are independent. Planets orbit the
            Sun, while constellations remain relatively fixed in their positions
            in the galaxy.
