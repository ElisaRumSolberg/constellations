      <h1>About Constellations</h1>
      <p>
        Constellations are groups of stars that form specific patterns in the
        sky and are associated with certain figures. Humanity has studied the
        night sky for thousands of years, connecting these stars to shapes and
        mythological figures. <br />
        <br />In ancient civilizations such as Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and
        China, people discovered star patterns and gave them names. The earliest
        records of constellations date back to around 3000 B.C. on Mesopotamian
        tablets. Greek astronomer Ptolemy, who laid the foundations of Western
        astronomy, listed 48 constellations in his work "Almagest" and created a
        systematic sky map. <br />
        <br />
        In addition to their mythological meanings, constellations played an
        important role in navigation and agriculture. Well-known constellations
        like Ursa Major (the Great Bear), Ursa Minor (the Little Bear), and
        Orion have served as guides in the night sky for travelers. Today, there
        are 88 constellations officially recognized by the International
        Astronomical Union. These constellations divide the sky into specific
        regions, making astronomical observations easier.

        >
        <div class="faq_answer">
          <p>
            A star’s brightness depends on its size, temperature, and distance
            from Earth. Brighter stars are often either closer to us or larger
            in size.

          <p>
